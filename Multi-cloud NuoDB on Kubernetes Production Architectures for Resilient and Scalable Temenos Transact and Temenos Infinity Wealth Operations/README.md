# Multi-cloud NuoDB on Kubernetes Production Architectures for Resilient and Scalable Temenos Transact and Temenos Infinity Wealth Operations

The prerequisites for this lab are:
1. Accounts with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) public Cloud
Service Providers (CSP).
In this lab we will use Linux Virtual Machines provided by these two CSPâ€™s Infrastructure as
a Service (IaaS) offerings. In the case of corporate AWS/GCP accounts, your privileges
must allow launching of VMs, including setting firewalls, root login access on those machines
for software installation and Internet access to download software components.
If you do not have AWS/GCP accounts it is possible to do parts of this lab on a personal
computer, however we recommend signing up for CSP accounts, as the lab instructions are
for written and validated on AWS/GCP. The expected cost for the VMs used for the lab
exercises is under ten USD for the 2 VMs that are required.

2. A personal computer or other device with a current web browser, e.g. Firefox.
No other software is required on your PC. Optionally, ssh and kubectl tools, available for
Linux, MacOS and Linux, can be used to access the VMs and the Rancher/Kubernetes
container platform in the lab from a PC.

3. Linux shell command line knowledge is desirable, but not required.
