## Module Three: Building models – Focus on XAI

**Duration**: 15 mins

In this module you will be creating models from the features prepared in the previous modules. We will focus con Explainable models.

## Module Four: Model life cycle and monitoring

**Duration**: 15 mins

In this module you will learn about a model’s life cycle in the context of your Organisation, and how to monitor its performance over time

## Module Five: Interpretability

**Duration**: 15 mins

In this module you will learn about the three different levels of interpretability that can be obtained through an XAI model:
- Population level.
- Subpopulation level.
- Individual level.

## Module Six: Actionable Insights

**Duration**: 15 mins

In this module you will learn how to harness XAI models and their explainability to evaluate “what if” scenarios.

## Module Seven: Including expert knowledge

**Duration**: 15 mins

In this module you will learn how to use the “Scenario” functionality, allowing you to include expert domain knowledge into XAI models.

## Module Eight: Deployment and pipelines

**Duration**: 5 mins

This module is just informative, in order to let the user know how to use deployed models in isolation or within a cascaded pipeline.
