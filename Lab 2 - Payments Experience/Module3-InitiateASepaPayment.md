## Module 3: Initiate a SEPA payment

**Duration**: 30 mins

Purpose: This lab introduces the subject of working with Payment APIâ€™s 
After completing the lab, you should be able to:

**Initiate a SEPA payment transaction**

**SEPA transaction**
1. To initiate a SEPA transaction, we are going to use end point https://api.temenos.com/api/v1.0.0/order/paymentOrders
2. API documentation - https://apidocs.temenos.com/service/payment-orders#operation/createPaymentOrder
3. To post a payment, we will have to form the Payload. Payment can accept various parameters in Payload Body. 
4. Parameters that can be used for initiating a payment

**Initiating SEPA transaction**
1. In this example we will use the following Payload to initiate SEPA payment
```
{
  {
  "header": {},
  "body": {
      "paymentOrderProductId": "SEPA",
    "debitAccountIBAN": "GB88DEMO60161300080737",
    "paymentCurrencyId": "EUR",
    "amount": "50",
    "accountWithBankBIC": "BARCGB22",
    "beneficiaryIBAN": "DE92100400000012345678",
    "orderingCustomerName": "Rolf Gerling",
    "endToEndReference": "TEST SEPA",
    "executionDate": "2020-04-17",
    "beneficiaryName": "GENERAL MOTORS"
  }
}
```

**Module 3: Lab Summary**

In the third module, we executed an API to initiate a SEPA Payment.

At this point, we will move on to [Part 4](https://github.com/temenos/SCALE2020/blob/main/Lab%202%20-%20Payments%20Experience/Module4-InitiateASepaInstantPayment.md), where we will see how to initiate a SEPA instant payment.
