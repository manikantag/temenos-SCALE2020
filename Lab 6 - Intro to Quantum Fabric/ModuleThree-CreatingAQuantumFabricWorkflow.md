Tasks you will complete in this lab exercise include:

Import a Fabric app which includes:
- An Object Service called LoanApplicationObjS.
- A Business Rule Set called LoanApprovalRules.
- A Mock Integration Service called CreditBureauMock.
- Create a new Workflow based on the previously existing services mentioned above.
- Publish the newly created workflow.
- Test the newly created workflow.

## Module 3: Lab Instructions

















**Module 3: Lab Summary**
During this lab you’ve designed, published and tested a workflow. As you will have been able to appreciate, workflows are advanced tools that build on top of other Fabric constructs, such as Integration Services, Object Services, Business Rules and Engagement Services. If you’ve struggled with these concepts we recommend you go back and explore the labs and other enablement materials that go over these other features in more detail.

Also, workflows are very powerful tools that will allow you to decouple client apps from business processes. If used right, Fabric Workflows could allow you to change processes without affecting the client applications or having to distribute new versions of them. They could also allow you to start a user journey on one device, continue on a second device and finish on a third one. 

However, workflows should not be abused. Not everything in your app is necessarily a good candidate to be modelled as a Fabric Workflow. Some use cases may be too simple or trivial to become workflows. Meanwhile, others may be way too large or complex. Fabric Workflows are meant as a lightweight solution for use cases which commonly arise when building multi-experience digital experiences, but not as a fully-fledged BPMS for the entire enterprise.
